## Overview
### Description
Turning data into a business plan can be a long and costly journey. By having a consistent data pipeline to quickly turn data into a few key insights, all displayed on a clean and cohesive dashboard, we can make this process easier.

## Approach
We created a web application that works with existing and future datasets to create an interactive dashboard for discovering insights such as:
- Market Share: Changes in market share between different merchants, these can be refined in a number of ways, from state and regional changes to different time ranges. These can be used to highlight anomalies for further study.
- Sales: A variety of plots depicting the number of sales across time ranges for different companies.

## How it Works


## Conclusion
Using the data provided by Edison Trends, we created several graphical visualizations to present insights into the data. This includes graphs to explore the change in market share for select companies, show the overall change in sales across a specified date range, and a map showing the change in market share percentage for a company by the state. These were then integrated into a single front end web app, that allows the user to configure the parameters and generate each visualization. The data may be updated, to allow the production of up-to-date graphs.
